# XSS Test
This application was created for the course DA563A Introduction to Computer Security at Kristianstad University Sweden.

This is a application to demonstrate an XSS attack on a website. It's a very simple application which demonstrates XSS attacks by inserting malicious code into the database of a web application and then not properly escaping the text when retrieving it. It also demonstrates an XSS attack using the query string in a URL with a website which displays the content of a variable in the query string.
